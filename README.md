It has been demonstrated that the environment controls significant facets of psychological impact. Ideas for intelligent spatial control have also been investigated extensively throughout past years. Enhancing the energy efficiency and occupant comfort through customized command was one of the major aspects. Although sympathetic response detection has been employed in biofeedback-driven and mindfulness - based systems for years, increasingly sophisticated context recognition methods that take affective state into play have made it possible for a new generation of applications. The drive to understand more about ourselves and to give users tools to foster a greater sense of self-awareness has driven a significant portion of research in this area. Existing research has utilized such information to provide users with opportunities for self-awareness through means of visualization and self-representation. The proposed research explores the potential in enhancing awareness towards bodily status through the construction of a Mixed Reality and wearables system.
